## Bug Number 1:
Ran the tester on handout files
emptySet_testIsEmpty fails

Set breakpoint in SetTester on line 111, location of the tester method
Stepped Over to line 658, where a try catch block tests the isEmpty() method
on a valid set, on line 42 of ArrayList

Found on line 42 the isEmpty() method performs a boolean statement:
return (rear > 0);

Where rear is initially assigned to be zero. This statement will always
return false since it does not check if equal to zero.

Added statement to fix changing the greater than operator to is ( == ) operator.

Reran the tester class and emptySet_testIsEmpty passes.

## Bug Number 2:
Ran the tester on handout files
emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty fails

Set breakpoint in SetTester on line 147, location of tester method
Stepped into, where a set is constructed and an element is added.
Stepped over to line 658, where a try catch block tests again the isEmpty() method
Even after adding an element value, rear never is updated so the isEmpty() method returns True
when the expectation is False.

Ran the debugger at the same breakpoint and steppend into line 137, where the add() method is called.
Nowhere in the block is rear incremented.

Added the statement:
rear++

To ensure rear is incremented when a value is added to the array

Reran the tester class and emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty passes.

## Bug Number 3:
Ran the tester on handout files
A_addB_AB_testRemoveA fails

Set breakpoint in SetTester on line 265, location of tester method.
Stepped into, where again an empty set is created and then two values are added to the set.
Steppend into the next method, where testRemove() is attempted on line 604.
Steppend into testRemove() where remove() is attempting to remove an element value
Index out of bounds error exception is printed.

Modified the while loop statement to take the value of rear and minus 1, to avoid going over
index bound (since a 2 size array has values of 0 and 1, no accessible space for 2)

Reran the tester class and the A_addB_AB_testRemoveA passes, as well as the remaining tests.
